  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  I'm currently living my dream, studying at <a href="https://robotics.asu.edu/">ASU Robotics @ ASU</a>, and working on Stretch R1 Robot. Pursuing an <a href="https://ras.engineering.asu.edu/">M.S. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, Batch of 2024, I aim to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with a focus on perception, Machine Learning, and Aerial Robotics. My engineering philosophy merges automation and AI for operational efficiency. I am a passionate robotics enthusiast, continuously seeking opportunities for growth and innovation, applying my knowledge to real-world challenges.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">IIT Patna</a> in 2022 with a Bachelor’s in <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/departments/engineering-technology/mechanical-engineering/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. I was recognized as an Undergraduate Project Finalist for successfully developing a Motion Prediction model for a Towed floating object under <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/people-6/faculty/2-uncategorised/241-view-profile-38">Prof. Subrata Kumar</a> during my Mechanical Engineering degree program.

  <h2 style="font-size: 25px"><b>Robotic Achievements and Research</b></h2>
  <br>

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  Under my leadership, our team achieved recognition in robotics, becoming <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kweAUygwfA52OVF7uBK29grWofsJmhxy/view?usp=sharing">National finalists</a> in the 2019-20 <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-Yantra International Robotics Competition</a> organized by <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>. We developed an autonomous transportation mobile robot, showcasing innovation in disaster management. Additionally, I developed a simulator ecosystem for autonomous evaluation of the <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-YRC competition</a>, earning recognition in the prestigious <a href="https://www.e-yantra.org/eysip">e-YIC program</a> under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavi-arya/?originalSubdomain=in">Prof. Kavi Arya</a> from <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay's Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>.

    <b>What Sets Me Apart</b>
  </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <u><b>Resilience</b></u>: My resilience shone through when I overcame the initial setback of failing the JEE Advanced exam, eventually securing admission to my dream institute, IIT. This determination persisted through challenges in robotics competitions, internships, and research, shaping me into a tenacious problem solver and innovator.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <u><b>Curiosity</b></u>: I possess a natural eagerness to delve into the mechanics and technological advancements that power everyday gadgets.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <u><b>Hacker mindset</b></u>: When creating a robot in R.O.S., I find Visual Studio Code more efficient than editing in a terminal within a docker environment. The speed of VScode and the availability of helpful plugins make it easier for me to create an environment and build a URDF file for a robot, as well as develop C++ plugins. This has made the process smoother and more streamlined.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 style="font-size: 25px">My Approach: Tackling Complex Problems with Passion</h2>

  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  I harness these skills and traits to tackle complex problems, prioritizing problem quality. My passion lies in machine learning and perception methods as they relate to robotics. With experience ranging from short-term code that secured wins in national and international robotics competitions to long-term contributions to open-source projects, my software engineering expertise is versatile and adaptive, honed through various professional experiences.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    In addition to coding and robotics, I find immense joy in appreciating the talent and creativity of artists and musicians. There's nothing that electrifies me more than watching AC/DC's mesmerizing performance of "<a href="https://youtu.be/xRQnJyP77tY">Shoot To Thrill</a>" on the drums, and listening to Miles Teller's rendition of "<a href="https://youtu.be/pVcMsjyKlaM">Great Balls of Fire</a>" never fails to fill me with pure joy.

  <h2 id="Questionsexcitesme" style="font-size: 30px"><b>Questions that Excite me</b></h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
    <li><b>Robotic Autonomy in Unstructured Environments:</b> How can we enhance the autonomy of robots to navigate and perform complex tasks in unstructured, unpredictable environments such as disaster-stricken areas or space exploration missions? This question explores the challenges of developing robots that can adapt and make decisions independently in challenging scenarios.</li>
    <li><b>AI for Sustainability:</b> How can AI-powered robotics contribute to sustainable practices in agriculture, energy, and environmental monitoring? Engineers can work on developing robots that optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and address critical sustainability challenges.</li>
    <li><b>Experiential Learning in Robotics:</b> How can robots gain real-world experience to improve their performance and adaptability? This area explores methods for robots to accumulate knowledge through practical experience, similar to how humans learn from trial and error.</li>
