  <h2><b>Academic and Robotics Pursuits</b></h2>
  <br>

  <p>
  I'm living my dream, studying at <a href="https://robotics.asu.edu/">A.S.U. Robotics @ A.S.U.</a>, and working on Stretch R1 Robot. Pursuing an <a href="https://ras.engineering.asu.edu/">M.S. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, Batch of 2024, I aim to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with a focus on perception, Machine Learning, and Aerial Robotics. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p >
  I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">IIT Patna</a> in 2022 with a Bachelorâ€™s in <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/departments/engineering-technology/mechanical-engineering/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. During my program, I developed a Motion Prediction model for a Towed floating object under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/people-6/faculty/2-uncategorised/241-view-profile-38">Prof. Subrata Kumar</a>. My Bachelor's Capstone project earned recognition as an Undergraduate Project Finalist for its technical excellence in this area.

  <h6   id="achievements"><b>Achievements on Robotics and it's Research</b></h6>
  <br>

  <p >
  Under my leadership, our team achieved recognition in robotics, becoming <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kweAUygwfA52OVF7uBK29grWofsJmhxy/view?usp=sharing">National finalists</a> in the 2019-20 <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-Yantra International Robotics Competition</a> organized by <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>. We developed an autonomous transportation mobile robot, showcasing innovation in disaster management. Additionally, I devised a simulator ecosystem for autonomous evaluation of the <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-YRC competition</a>, earning recognition in the prestigious <a href="https://www.e-yantra.org/eysip">e-YIC program</a> under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavi-arya/?originalSubdomain=in">Prof. Kavi Arya</a> from <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay's Department of Computer Science & Engineering.</a>

    <b>What Sets Me Apart</b>
  </h2><br>
  <p >
    <u><b>Resilience</b></u>: My resilience shone through when I overcame the initial setback of failing (96.85 percentile) the JEE Advanced exam, eventually securing admission (with 99.49 percentile) to my dream institute, IIT. This determination persisted through challenges in robotics competitions, internships, and research, shaping me into a tenacious problem solver and innovator.
  </p>
  <p >
    <u><b>Curiosity</b></u>: I am eager to explore the mechanics and technological advancements that power everyday gadgets.
  </p>
  <p >
    <u><b>Hacker mindset</b></u>: When creating a robot in R.O.S., I find Visual Studio Code more efficient than editing in a terminal within a docker environment. The speed of VScode and the availability of helpful plugins make it easier for me to create an environment, build a URDF file for a robot, and develop C++ plugins. This addition has made the process smoother and more streamlined.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h6><b>My Approach: Tackling Complex Problems with Passion</b></h6>


  <p >
  I harness the <a href="#distinguishesme">skills and traits mentioned above</a> to tackle complex problems, prioritizing problem quality. My passion lies in machine learning and perception methods related to robotics. With experience ranging from short-term code that secured wins in national and international robotics competitions to long-term contributions to open-source projects, my software engineering expertise is versatile and adaptive, honed through various professional experiences.
  </p>
  
  <p >
    In addition to coding and robotics, I find immense joy in appreciating the talent and creativity of artists and musicians. Nothing that electrifies me more than watching AC/DC's mesmerizing performance of "<a href="https://youtu.be/xRQnJyP77tY">Shoot To Thrill</a>" on the drums, and listening to Miles Teller's rendition of "<a href="https://youtu.be/pVcMsjyKlaM">Great Balls of Fire</a>" never fills me with pure joy.
