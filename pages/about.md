  <p style="font-size: 20px">Hello there  <img class="emoji" title=":wave:" alt=":wave:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" height="20" width="20"> I am <b>Narendhiran</b>. You call me Naren (Naa-R-ehN). </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px">
    I'm currently living my dream — studying at the epicenter of innovation,<a href="https://robotics.asu.edu/"> ASU Robotics @ ASU</a>, and working on Stretch R1 Robot. 
    
    I'm pursuing <a href="https://ras.engineering.asu.edu/"> M.S. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems program</a>, Batch of 2024. Through my life’s work, I want to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with three focuses: perception, Machine Learning, and Aerial Robotics.  As an engineer, I believe incorporating automation with artificial intelligence in problem-solving would enlarge efficiency in operations.

    I am robotics enthusiast and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my horizon.
    Learning new things is fun but applying them to real-life problems is what thrills me the most. I strive to see the big picture and understand the connections between basic tasks and long-term targets. 
    <br>

    I intend to use this corner of the web to give the world a peek into my mind and to share updates about my work.

    I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">IIT Patna</a> in 2022, attaining a Bachelor’s in <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/departments/engineering-technology/mechanical-engineering/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. Accomplished selection as an Undergraduate Project Finalist, measured by the successful development of a Motion Prediction model for a Towed floating object, through working with <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/people-6/faculty/2-uncategorised/241-view-profile-38">Prof. Subrata Kumar</a> at IIT Patna during my Mechanical Engineering degree program.

    Under my leadership, our team achieved recognition in robotics by developing an autonomous transportation mobile robot for international search and rescue challenges. We were selected as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kweAUygwfA52OVF7uBK29grWofsJmhxy/view?usp=sharing">National finalists</a> in the 2019-20 <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-Yantra International Robotics Competition</a> organized by <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, showcasing our innovative solution and potential impact in disaster management. Through 6 months of dedicated work, innovation, and teamwork, our robot's exceptional capabilities caught the judges' attention, cementing our accomplishment and affirming our commitment to leveraging robotics for meaningful impact.


    <!-- The team I led developed an autonomous transportation mobile robot to compete in the <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-Yantra International Robotics Competition</a> (e-YRC) organized by <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, intending to solve the international search and rescue for disaster management challenges.

    My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial intelligence and robotics. You can read the research questions that I find very fascinating <a href="https://naren200.github.io/">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    What distinguishes me, however, is my resilience, curiosity, and hacker mindset.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>Resilience</b>:  I have demonstrated resilience by navigating complex projects with tight deadlines and overcoming technical obstacles by staying focused, adapting strategies, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions, leveraging setbacks as learning opportunities, and consistently striving for excellence in the ever-evolving field of robotics. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>Curiosity</b>: I enjoy exploring the inner workings and technological innovations that power everyday devices as a pastime.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>Hacker mindset</b>: When creating a robot in R.O.S., I find Visual Studio Code more efficient than editing in a terminal within a docker environment. The speed of VScode and the availability of helpful plugins make it easier for me to create an environment and build a URDF file for a robot, as well as develop C++ plugins. This has made the process smoother and more streamlined.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    I utilize all of these skills and characteristics to tackle complex problems that require creative solutions. I particularly enjoy taking on challenging problems and prioritizing the quality of the problem over other factors. My greatest passion lies in the field of machine learning and perception methods as they relate to robotics.
    With experience ranging from short-term code that won me national and international robotics competitions to long-term contributions to open-source projects, my software engineering expertise is versatile and adaptive, honed through various professional experiences. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    In addition to my passion for coding and robotics, I derive great joy from admiring the talent and creativity of artists and musicians who are more gifted than I am. Nothing electrifies me more than watching AC/DC's electrifying performance of "<a href="https://youtu.be/xRQnJyP77tY">Shoot To Thrill</a>" on the drums, and listening to Miles Teller's rendition of "<a href="https://youtu.be/pVcMsjyKlaM">Great Balls of Fire</a>" never fails to fill me with pure joy.
