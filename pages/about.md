  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  I'm currently living my dream, studying at <a href="https://robotics.asu.edu/">ASU Robotics @ ASU</a>, and working on Stretch R1 Robot. Pursuing an <a href="https://ras.engineering.asu.edu/">M.S. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, Batch of 2024, I aim to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with a focus on perception, Machine Learning, and Aerial Robotics. My engineering philosophy merges automation and AI for operational efficiency. I am a passionate robotics enthusiast, continuously seeking opportunities for growth and innovation, applying my knowledge to real-world challenges.

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">IIT Patna</a> in 2022 with a Bachelor’s in <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/departments/engineering-technology/mechanical-engineering/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. I was recognized as an Undergraduate Project Finalist for successfully developing a Motion Prediction model for a Towed floating object under <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/people-6/faculty/2-uncategorised/241-view-profile-38">Prof. Subrata Kumar</a> during my Mechanical Engineering degree program.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  Under my leadership, our team achieved recognition in robotics, becoming <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kweAUygwfA52OVF7uBK29grWofsJmhxy/view?usp=sharing">National finalists</a> in the 2019-20 <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-Yantra International Robotics Competition</a> organized by <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>. We developed an autonomous transportation mobile robot, showcasing innovation in disaster management. Additionally, I developed a simulator ecosystem for autonomous evaluation of the <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-YRC competition</a>, earning recognition in the prestigious <a href="https://www.e-yantra.org/eysip">e-YIC program</a> under <a href="https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~kavi/">Prof. Kavi Arya</a> from <a href="">IIT Bombay's Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>.

    <b>What distinguishes me, however, is my resilience, curiosity, and hacker mindset. </b>
  </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>Resilience</b>:  I have demonstrated resilience by navigating complex projects with tight deadlines and overcoming technical obstacles by staying focused, adapting strategies, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions, leveraging setbacks as learning opportunities, and consistently striving for excellence in the ever-evolving field of robotics. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>Curiosity</b>: I enjoy exploring the inner workings and technological innovations that power everyday devices as a pastime.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <b>Hacker mindset</b>: When creating a robot in R.O.S., I find Visual Studio Code more efficient than editing in a terminal within a docker environment. The speed of VScode and the availability of helpful plugins make it easier for me to create an environment and build a URDF file for a robot, as well as develop C++ plugins. This has made the process smoother and more streamlined.

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    I utilize all of these skills and characteristics to tackle complex problems that require creative solutions. I particularly enjoy taking on challenging problems and prioritizing the quality of the problem over other factors. My greatest passion lies in the field of machine learning and perception methods as they relate to robotics.
    With experience ranging from short-term code that won me national and international robotics competitions to long-term contributions to open-source projects, my software engineering expertise is versatile and adaptive, honed through various professional experiences. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    In addition to my passion for coding and robotics, I derive great joy from admiring the talent and creativity of artists and musicians who are more gifted than I am. Nothing electrifies me more than watching AC/DC's electrifying performance of "<a href="https://youtu.be/xRQnJyP77tY">Shoot To Thrill</a>" on the drums, and listening to Miles Teller's rendition of "<a href="https://youtu.be/pVcMsjyKlaM">Great Balls of Fire</a>" never fails to fill me with pure joy.

  <h2 id="Questionsexcitesme" style="font-size: 20px"><b>Questions that Excite me</b></h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
    <li><b>Human-Robot Interaction:</b> How can we develop intuitive and natural interfaces that enable seamless communication and collaboration between humans and robots? I am fascinated by the possibilities of creating socially-aware robots that can understand human intentions, adapt to dynamic environments, and assist humans in various tasks while ensuring safety and trust.</li>
    <li><b>Explainable and Transparent AI:</b> How can we design AI algorithms and models that are interpretable and explainable, enabling humans to understand the decision-making process of autonomous systems? I am intrigued by the challenge of developing AI systems that not only provide accurate predictions and actions but also offer insights into their reasoning to build trust and facilitate collaboration between humans and robots.</li>
    <li><b>Lifelong Learning in Robotics:</b> How can we develop robots that can continuously learn and adapt to new situations, tasks, and environments? I am passionate about exploring lifelong learning algorithms and techniques that enable robots to acquire new knowledge, generalize from past experiences, and autonomously improve their performance over time, similar to how humans learn and adapt throughout their lives.</li>
    <li><b>Ethical and Responsible AI:</b> How can we ensure that AI-powered robots operate ethically, responsibly, and in alignment with human values? I am interested in exploring frameworks and methodologies for integrating ethical considerations into the design and development of autonomous systems, such as fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability, to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment in real-world scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
