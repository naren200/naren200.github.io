### Low-Level Flight software: Unmanned Vehicle

Developed a low-level software architecture for a mini drone named Mambo using control systems, sensor fusion, and computer vision techniques. The objective was to enable autonomous line following through image processing. Achievements include precise navigation using localization, mapping, and a sophisticated control system, showcasing the potential of robotics and computer vision in real-world applications. The project successfully integrates technologies such as Kalman filter, sensor fusion, and MATLAB-based implementation for rigorous testing and implementation.
