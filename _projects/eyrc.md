# eYantra Robotics Competition

*Theme - Construct-O-Bot Objective*: This theme simulates a disaster site, where robots retrieve construction materials and navigate complex paths to deliver them for reconstruction. Success requires efficient delivery to multiple sites, including diverse terrains. <u>The winning team completes the task swiftly with minimal penalties</u>.

# Retrofitting challenges:

1. **Gripper Misorientation:** Fast robot movements caused gripper misorientation during material pickup, hindering simulation accuracy. The solution involved increasing gripper contact surface (Fig. 4 & 6).

2. **Height Discrepancy:** The robot's 15cm height had to pick up material from a 3cm elevation. An L-shaped arm with servos for arm and gripper was implemented for cost-effectiveness (Fig. 5).

3. **Sensor Data Optimization:** LCD displays introduced lag during sensor calibration. Eliminating the LCD and using Tera-Term for serial communication resolved this issue
