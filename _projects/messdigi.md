# Home-Service Robot Project

## Overview
The **Home-Service Robot project** serves as a comprehensive showcase of robotics expertise, leveraging state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to demonstrate a mobile robot's capabilities in a simulated environment. This project harnesses the power of **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, **Gazebo simulation**, advanced **mapping**, **localization**, and **path planning** to illustrate the robot's prowess in autonomous navigation and manipulation.

## **Environment Design and Modeling**
### Building Editor, Model Editor, and Plugins
The project entails the creation of a dynamic environment using the **Building Editor** in Gazebo, offering ample space for the robot's operations. The environment features diverse elements and vibrant colors, enhancing the robot's navigation experience. The robot itself is meticulously designed using the **Model Editor**, ensuring precise integration of sensors and mechanical components. **Fixed joints** connect the robot's model links, guaranteeing stability during movement.

- **Gazebo Plugins**: The robot is equipped with advanced sensors, including **lidar** and **camera**, with **Gazebo plugins** seamlessly integrated to facilitate differential drive, lidar sensing, and camera functionality.

## **Autonomous Operation**
### Ball Chasing
A key highlight of the project is the robot's ability to autonomously **chase a white-colored ball** within the environment. This impressive capability is achieved through the implementation of ROS nodes for interaction and navigation.

## **Precise Localization**
### AMCL Package
Accurate **localization** is fundamental to the robot's autonomy. The project utilizes the **Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL)** package, a particle filter-based algorithm. AMCL leverages a known map and sensor data, such as laser scans and odometry, to estimate the robot's pose (position and orientation) within the environment.

## **Mapping and Navigation**
### Gmapping and Move_Base
Efficient **mapping** and **navigation** are achieved using the **gmapping** package for 2D occupancy grid mapping. This technology allows the robot to build and utilize maps for its autonomous movement. The **move_base** package serves as the high-level navigation controller, employing a combination of global and local path planning algorithms to enable obstacle avoidance and efficient goal attainment.
