### Visualization and Prediction of Two-Dimensional Motion of Towed Objects in Ship Operations

#### Introduction

This project aims to develop a visualizable prediction model for the **two-dimensional motion** of towed objects in ship operations, with a specific focus on situations involving **maneuvering or changing course**. The towed objects in question are hydrophone systems towed by military vessels, which are crucial for signal reception and tracking in both commercial and military applications.

#### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Visualizable Model:** Develop a visualizable model for accurately predicting the position and orientation of a towed object attached to a ship or submarine underwater.

2. **Geo-Positioning:** Determine the geo-position of the towed object even when the ship is maneuvering or changing course.

3. **Impact Analysis:** Investigate the impact of mass and drag coefficient variations on the trajectory of the towed object.

#### Methodology

The project utilizes a comprehensive methodology to achieve its objectives, including the consideration of **drag forces** and various scenarios. The key components of the methodology include:

1. **Drag Force Analysis:** The project considers drag forces acting on the towed object, taking into account both **form drag** and **skin friction drag**, and employs the **drag force coefficient** formula.
2. **Assumptions:** Several assumptions are made to simplify the problem, such as assuming 2D dynamics, a still water surface, and the ability of the towed array system to overcome disturbances caused by waves.
3. **Global Position Distribution:** A flow chart is presented to illustrate the process of determining the coordinates of the ship's position and each element's position along the trajectory.
4. **Runge-Kutta Method:** The project employs the **Runge-Kutta method** to compute the angular position and angular velocity of each element at various time steps.

5. **Animation:** The **Matplotlib library** in Python is used to create animations that visualize the motion of the towed object and the ship.

6. **Impact Analysis:** The project assesses the impact of forces such as **reaction force** and **drag coefficient variations** on the towed object's path.
