This is ithe poetry, that I wrote in my fifth grade. Though at that time I didnt completely understand the message this poetry emphasizes on, but today I understand the importance of this! Forgive me for the inncocent mistakes that I have made :p

```
Haar na manna tum kabhi
Bas chalte chalo, chalte chalo

Dukh aayengein aane do
Mushqil ko aasan karo
Haar na manna tum kabhi
Bas chalte chalo, chalte chalo

Haar gaye toh kya hua
Aage badhte chalo
Sar jhukhana mat kabhi
Aage badhte chalo

Haar na manna tum kabhi
Bas chalte chalo, chalte chalo
