  Welcome! I am Narendhiran Saravanane. My friends call me Naren (Naa-R-ehN).
</p>
<p>
  I am currently living my dream — studying at the epicenter of innovation,<a href="https://robotics.asu.edu/"> ASU Robotics @ ASU</a>, and working on Stretch R1 Robot. I am in the <a href="https://ras.engineering.asu.edu/"> M.S. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems program</a>, Batch of 2024. Through my life’s work, I want to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with three focuses: perception, Machine Learning, and Aerial Robotics.  As an engineer, I believe incorporating automation with artificial intelligence in problem-solving would enlarge efficiency in operations.

</p>
<p>

  I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">IIT Patna</a> in 2022, attaining a Bachelor’s in <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors. I worked with <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/people-6/faculty/2-uncategorised/241-view-profile-38">Prof. Subrata Kumar</a> on my Undergraduate Project to create a Motion Prediction model for a Towed floating object.
</p>
<p>
  The team I led developed an autonomous transportation mobile robot to compete in the <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-Yantra International Robotics Competition</a> (e-YRC) organized by <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, intending to solve the international search and rescue for disaster management challenges. After six months of hard work and innovation, our efforts were recognized as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kweAUygwfA52OVF7uBK29grWofsJmhxy/view?usp=sharing">one of the National finalists</a> in the 2019-20 e-YRC.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, I had the privilege of being selected to participate in the <a href="https://www.e-yantra.org/eysip">e-YIC program</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~kavi/">Prof. Kavi Arya</a> from the <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>. During this program, I was able to develop a simulator ecosystem that could autonomously evaluate the <a href="https://portal.e-yantra.org/#about">e-YRC competition</a> in which I had previously participated.
</p>
<p>
  My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Perception methods in robotic systems. You can read the research questions that I find very fascinating <a href="https://naren200.github.io/">here</a>.
</p>
<p> 
  What distinguishes me, however, is my resilience, curiosity, and hacker mindset.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Resilience</i>: As a student, I exhibited grit by persevering through disappointment in the JEE-Advanced exam and re-attempting it with passion and confidence, focusing on delivering my utmost effort and improving my skills through practical implications to impact society's ground reality. 
</p>
<p>

  <i>Curiosity</i>: I enjoy exploring the inner workings and technological innovations that power everyday devices as a pastime.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Hacker mindset</i>: When creating a robot in R.O.S., I find Visual Studio Code more efficient than editing in a terminal within a docker environment. The speed of VScode and the availability of helpful plugins make it easier for me to create an environment and build a URDF file for a robot, as well as develop C++ plugins. This has made the process smoother and more streamlined.
</p>
<p>
  I utilize all of these skills and characteristics to tackle complex problems that require creative solutions. I particularly enjoy taking on challenging problems and prioritizing the quality of the problem over other factors. My greatest passion lies in the field of machine learning and perception methods as they relate to robotics.
  With experience ranging from short-term code that won me national and international robotics competitions to long-term contributions to open-source projects, my software engineering expertise is versatile and adaptive, honed through various professional experiences. 
</p>
<p>  
  In addition to my passion for coding and robotics, I derive great joy from admiring the talent and creativity of artists and musicians who are more gifted than I am. Nothing electrifies me more than watching AC/DC's electrifying performance of "<a href="https://youtu.be/xRQnJyP77tY">Shoot To Thrill</a>" on the drums, and listening to Miles Teller's rendition of "<a href="https://youtu.be/pVcMsjyKlaM">Great Balls of Fire</a>" never fails to fill me with pure joy.
